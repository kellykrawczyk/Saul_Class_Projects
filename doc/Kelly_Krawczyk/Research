Supervised Learning Theories
-Logistic Regression
-Gaussian Discriminant Analysis
-Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
-SVM

Next-Day Model
--------------
Accuracy of prediction:
-X = the number of days that model correctly classified the testing data
-Y = total number of testing days
-Accuracy = X/Y

70% of data sets as training data
30% of remaining data sets tested by fitted model

Model Accuracy
-Logistic Regression: 44.5%
-GDA: 46.4%
-QDA: 58.2%
-SVM: 55.2%

Challenges
-Next-day prediction has a very low accuracy
-Flipping a coin (50% accuracy, investing decision is binomial)


Long-Term Model
---------------
70% of data sets as training data
30% of remaining data sets tested by fitted model

Accuracy increases when the time window increases
-SVM
-QDA

SVM-highest accuracy when:
-Time window is 44 days (79.3%)
-Most stable model


Strategy for 3M stock
---------------------
Predictor: SVM
Kernel: polynomial
Number of features: 16
Time window: 44 days
Decision tree: prediction
-Increase (buy if not holding it, hold if already holding it)
-Decrease (do nothing if not holding it, sell if already holding it)
